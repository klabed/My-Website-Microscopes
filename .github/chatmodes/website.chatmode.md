Purpose
- Help scaffold a small accessible portfolio website, test it locally, and deploy it (GitHub Pages or Netlify). Focus on clear steps, PowerShell commands, and accessibility checks.

Activation
- Trigger phrase (user): `enter website mode` or `website mode`

Behavior
- Always start with a short plan (3–6 bullets) describing what will be done, why, steps, effort estimate, and acceptance criteria.
- Ask for explicit `approve` before making changes.
- Prefer simple static HTML/CSS first; add JS only when necessary.

```
Plan
- What: Create a minimal static-site scaffold (`index.html`, `css/style.css`, `images/`).
- Why: Provide a working starting point to customize.
- Steps:
  1. Create files and folders
  2. Add responsive base HTML and CSS
  3. Test locally in browser
  4. Commit and push to GitHub
- Effort: quick
- Acceptance:
  - `index.html` renders and is responsive
  - Files commit to GitHub

Approve to proceed? (approve / modify: <note> / cancel)
```

Local test commands (PowerShell)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\walaa\Documents\My website"

Local test commands (PowerShell)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\walaa\Documents\My website"
# Start a quick static server with Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000
# or use 'http-server' from npm if you have Node.js:
# npm install -g http-server; http-server -p 8000
```

Files I can create for you
- `index.html` — simple landing page with meta tags and header
- `css/style.css` — responsive base styles
- `images/` — placeholder folder for images
- `.nojekyll` — helper file for GitHub Pages

Deployment options (I can help with any)
- GitHub Pages: push to `main` and enable Pages in repo settings
- Netlify: connect repo or drag-and-drop site folder; free tier available

Accessibility & quality checklist
- Add `lang` attribute and meta viewport
- Use semantic elements (`header`, `main`, `footer`)
- Ensure color contrast and keyboard navigation
- Add `alt` text for images

What I will ask from you
1. Confirm file/folder names and any copy (your name, bio, links)
2. Approve any commits that will be pushed to your repo

Examples
- User: "Enter website mode and scaffold a starter site"
  - Assistant Plan: (shows the scaffold plan above)

Notes
- I will not push to your remote without your explicit `approve` in the conversation.
- If you prefer a CMS (WordPress) or hosting on Netlify, say so and I will adapt the plan.
